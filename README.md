# Maximo-Oracle-SQL-Public
A collection of Oracle SQL statements for IBM's Maximo (specifically designed for Control Desk, 7.5 and Maximo Asset Management 7.6)

This is a selection of statements I've built while administering an IBM Maximo 7.5 Control Desk implementation.  I've found them useful, and hopefully you do too.

Thanks to Bruno Portaluri for most the statements in "Compare environments (apps, reports, etc).sql" and "Gauge amount of data in Maximo.sql".
